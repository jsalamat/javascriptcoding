// create classes for primary, middle, and high schools. 
// Because these classes share properties and methods, 
// each will inherit from a parent School class. 
// Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:

// -SCHOOL-
// Properties: name (string), level (one of three strings: 'primary', 'middle', or 'high'), and numberOfStudents (number)
// Getters: all properties have getters
// Setters: the numberOfStudents property has a setter
// Methods: .quickFacts() and .pickSubstituteTeacher() (this is a static method)

// -PRIMARY-
// Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
// Properties: pickupPolicy (string)

// -MIDDLE-
// Does not include any additional properties or methods

// -HIGH-
// Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
// Properties: sportsTeams (array of strings)

// create the constructor() and getters for the four classes above. 
// Then, use the setter and methods specifications 
// in steps five, six, and seven to finish the project.
